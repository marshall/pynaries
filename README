Pynaries
---
A simple binary dependency resolver and manager library.

Declaring dependencies on a set of binaries is done through a python script, i.e:

import pynaries
from pynaries.site import *
from pynaries.bundle import *

AddPullSite(HTTPSite('myrepository.com', path='/pynaries'))
dependencies = [
	('com.mycompany.dep1', Equal, '1.0.1'),
	('com.mycompany.dep2', GreaterThan, '1.0.0'),
	('com.mycompany.dep3', LessThan, '2.0.0'),
	('com.mycompany.dep4', InRange, '1.0.0-2.0.0')
]

pynaries.fetch(dependencies)
